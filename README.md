OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a shipping products dashboard I created with the Power BI tool and Excel 
 for data cleansing. From the dashboard, what I observed is that some of the shipping projects 
 have been shipped to many countries and different customers, while others are not performing well. This could be due to the scarcity of the products or a small number of customers for such products across the geography. Additionally, 
the higher the number of customers for a particular product, the higher the profit they generate, and vice versa

CONCLUSION

I believe that in order to increase their profit from these products, 
  they should create more inventory of the scarce items and actively seek out 
  additional customers for such projects
